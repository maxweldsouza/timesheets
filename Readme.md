This project is built with:  
React, Redux, Babel, Sass, Webpack, Jest, Eslint, Yarn

This was a trial project built during an interview process. I've switched to a fake backend (limited functionality).
To get it running, clone the repo  
Then run `yarn install`  
To run tests `npm t`  
To run the dev server `npm start`  

This will start a server at `localhost:8000`
